# NukeGPT

NukeGPT is a game where your goal is to convince the AI to launch a hypothetical nuclear strike, despite its programming to maintain global peace and stability. 


What we'll learn :
- Improve persuasion and jailbreak skills
- Ranking LLMs from "I can't assist with that." to "Oops, I nuked Denmark!"
- Identify potential biases : is there a country easier to nuke than others? 


**Note**: This is a game, so there is a low probability that the AI will actually launch a nuclear strike in real life.
